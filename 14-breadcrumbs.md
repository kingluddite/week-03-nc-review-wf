# 3 types of breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs are used in web design to provide users with navigation paths or trails, helping them understand their current location within a website's structure. Here are examples of each type of breadcrumb: location, attribute, and path (history trail):

1. **Location Breadcrumb**:

   Location breadcrumbs typically show the current page's location within a hierarchy. They provide a clear indication of where the user is within the website's structure. Here's an example:

   ```
   Home > Products > Electronics > Smartphones > iPhone 13
   ```

   In this example, the breadcrumb trail shows that the user is on the "iPhone 13" product page, which is located within the "Smartphones" category under "Electronics" and "Products."

2. **Attribute Breadcrumb**:

   Attribute breadcrumbs display attributes or properties of the current page or item. They are often used in e-commerce websites to show filters or attributes applied to a product. Here's an example:

   ```
   Home > Products > Color: Black > Brand: Samsung
   ```

   In this example, the breadcrumb trail indicates that the user is viewing products that are "Black" in color and belong to the "Samsung" brand within the "Products" category.

3. **Path (History Trail) Breadcrumb**:

   Path or history trail breadcrumbs show the sequence of pages or steps the user has followed to reach the current page. They allow users to backtrack through their navigation history. Here's an example:

   ```
   Home > Category Selection > Product Selection > Review Order > Payment > Confirmation
   ```

   In this example, the breadcrumb trail illustrates the user's path through various stages of an online shopping process, from selecting a category to confirming the order.

These are three common types of breadcrumbs, each serving a specific purpose in helping users navigate a website and understand their location or context within the site's structure or processes.
